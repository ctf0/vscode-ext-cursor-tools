# Notice

as of vscode v1.54, the ext no longer works because of `Cannot add property cursorAnchors, object is not extensible` which is a fundamental part of how it operate.

based on https://github.com/naumovs/vscode-ext-cursor-tools + new features

### New

- add config to control the decoration styles
- add support to multi cursors
- change the default keybinding of decoration cancel
- remove camelcase nav as its natively supported by vscode
